# ARDUroid
## notes
This was my final project for an Android application development course at my university. It was my first time developing an app, and I decided to do some "physical computing". Since all the movement is computed by the Android device and then sent to the Arduino via serial communication, This device can do anything that a smartphone can do.

Features implemented:
* roam around on its own : Moves around randomly, but also uses the Android device's proximity sensor to detect obstacles and back away from it
* control with arrow keys :what's cool is that you can simply connect a bluetooth keyboard to the phone, and then that can act as the controller, no special hardware required!
* rock-paper-scissors : not demonstrated in the video, but it bobs its head up and down while doing it. I guess it's somewhat more interactive than doing it with a usual screen??
