# ARDUroid
This was my final project for an Android application development course at my university. It was my first time developing an app, but I decided to think outside the box and do some "physical computing". Since all the movement is computed by the Android device and then sent to the Arduino via serial communication, anything that a smartphone can do, this device can also do. I didn't have time to implement much features, but some things I hoped to do were:  have the app run in the background while taking commands, so that you can do a video chat while controlling the robot to achieve "telepresence" use the camera API to track faces and follow them  I do not own an Android device myself; I borrowed it from the instructor during the span of the course, and I'm not sure that I can achieve the same thing with an iPhone. So, sadly, it will never be its bumbling self again... RIP ARDUroid I do have some ideas about the next step though
